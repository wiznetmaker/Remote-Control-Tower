The premise of this project is to use the simplest components, add the network, and explore more interesting ways of using it. The previous Light Tower project used a WS2812 light ring and a paper clip as a touch button. This time the Remote Control Tower uses 4 paper clips as touch buttons, a WS2812 light ring as a status indicator, and an infrared transmitter to control other devices; all components used are shown in the figure below.
